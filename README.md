## 📚 What I Learned
- Challenged myself to learn useReducer() from the React docs alone and confirmed the takeaways by ChatGPT.
- Experimented with the nullish coalescing operator (??) to default action.payload, but realized it wasn't applicable since the payload was undefined, ended up using separate dispatched actions instead.
- Gained a better understanding of useEffect(), and also clarified a misconception about useRef(): Not to use it with audio playback since referencing a persistent DOM element wasn't needed.
- Confirmed WCAG guidelines don’t require controls unless sound plays automatically for more than 3 seconds and can’t be paused or stopped.
- Explored CSS3 animations with ChatGPT, and implemented subtle modal fade/pop effects for better interaction feedback.
